    <h1>What are Open-World Adventures games?</h1>
    <p class="open"><b>Open-World:</b> Open world games are characterized by offering players an interactive online world full of possibilities, where freedom is the key concept.

        Unlike traditional games that follow a predefined and closed progression, open world games allow gamers to explore the game world in a non-linear way.
        
        This means you can choose how, when, and where to explore, complete main or side quests, interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), and discover hidden secrets at your own pace.</p>
