    <h1 class="h01111">What is Plastic Pollution?</h1>
    <p class="p0"><b class="plastic">Plastic pollution:</b> Accumulation in the environment of synthetic plastic products to the point that they create problems for wildlife and their habitats as well as for human populations.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Impacts:</h3>
    <p class="his">His pollution <b class="marine">chokes marine wildlife, damages soil and poisons groundwater,</b> and can cause serious health impacts.</p>
    <h1 class="h12">What is Recycling Innovations?</h1>
    <p class="rec"><b class="re">Recycling technology:</b> Is constantly evolving and innovating, and these advancements are helping to increase recycling rates and reduce waste. Here are a few examples of the latest innovations in recycling technology that are making a real impact in the waste management industry:</p>
    <h3 class="h14">Impacts:</h3>
    <p class="bins"><b class="smart">Smart Bins:</b>
        Smart bins are equipped with sensors that can detect the type of waste that is being deposited and sort it accordingly. For example, a smart bin equipped with an infrared sensor can identify the type of plastic, which helps the recycler to process it more efficiently.
        <br>
        <b class="AI">Artificial Intelligence:</b>
        AI-powered cameras and sorting machines are being used to identify and sort different types of recyclable materials with a high degree of accuracy. This improves the efficiency of the recycling process and reduces the amount of contamination in the recycling stream.
        <br>
        <b class="D1">3D Printing:</b>
        3D printing is being used to recycle plastic waste into new products. This technology allows for the creation of new products using recycled plastic, reducing the need for virgin materials and waste.</p>
