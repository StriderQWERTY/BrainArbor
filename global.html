    <h1 class="h11">What is Global warning?</h1>
    <p class="global"><b class="go">Global warming</b>: Is a phenomenon of climate change characterized by a general increase in average temperatures of the Earth, which modifies the weather balances and ecosystems for a long time. It is directly linked to the increase of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, worsening the greenhouse effect.

        In fact, the average temperature of the planet has increased by <b class="go1">0.8º Celsius (33.4° Fahrenheit)</b> compared to the end of the 19th century. Each of the last three decades has been warmer than all previous decades since the beginning of the statistical surveys in 1850.
        
        At the pace of current CO2 emissions, scientists expect an increase of between <b class="go2">1.5° and 5.3°C (34.7° to 41.5°F)</b> in average temperature by 2100. If no action is taken, it would have harmful consequences to humanity and the biosphere.</p>
        <h3 class="h31">Impacts:</h3>
        <p class="fossil"><b class="h8">Fossil Fuels</b>: The massive use of fossil fuels is obviously the first source of global warming, as burning coal, oil and gas produces carbon dioxide - the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere - as well as nitrous oxide.
            <br>
            <b class="def">Deforestation:</b> the exploitation of forests has a major role in climate change. Trees help regulate the climate by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When they are cut down, this positive effect is lost and the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere.
            <br>
            <b class="int">Intensive farming:</b> another cause of global warming is intensive farming, not only with the ever-increasing livestock, but also with plant protection products and fertilizers. In fact, cattle and sheep produce large amounts of methane when digesting their food, while fertilizers produce nitrous oxide emissions.</p>
        <h1 class="h12">What is Climate Change?</h1>
        <p class="rising0"><b class="h13">Climate change:</b> Refers to significant and lasting changes in the Earth's temperatures and weather patterns.  These changes can be from natural causes (such as large volcanic activity) or from human activities. Since the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s, humans have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like <b class="etc">coal, oil, and gas.</b></p>
        <h3 class="img01">Impacts:</h3>
        <p class="rising"><b class="ri">Rising Global Temperatures:</b> The Earth's <b class="ave">average temperature has risen by about 1.2°C since the late 19th century,</b> with the last decade being the warmest on record.
<br>
            <b class="melting">Melting Polar Ice and Rising Sea Levels:</b> The polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate, contributing to rising sea levels, which threaten coastal communities worldwide.
            <br>
            <b class="extreme">Extreme Weather Events</b>: The frequency and intensity of hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires are increasing.
            <br>
            <b class="bio">Biodiversity Loss:</b> Many species are facing extinction due to changing habitats and ecosystems, disrupting the balance of natural systems.</p>
